# Dog Breed Classification Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify dog breeds from images using deep learning techniques. The model was trained and deployed as a web application using Flask. The system allows users to upload images of dogs and get predictions on the breed.

The project uses TensorFlow and Keras for model training and Flask for deploying the model as a web service.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for model training
- **Flask** for deploying the model as a web app
- **Python** for scripting
- **HTML/CSS** for frontend interface
- **Jupyter Notebook** (or Colab) for training and testing the model

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-breed-classification.git
cd dog-breed-classification
```

### 2. Set up the Environment

Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional, but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the Model

If the model is not already trained, you can train it using the Jupyter Notebook (or Colab). The model is based on the Stanford Dogs dataset and utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for classification. After training, save the model as `dog_breed_model.h5`.

### 4. Run the Flask App

To start the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the web server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### 5. Web Interface

The web interface allows you to upload an image of a dog. The model will predict the breed and display the result on the webpage.

### 6. Access the Flask App

Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to interact with the application.

## Future Improvements

- **Model Optimization**: Currently, the model can be optimized further with techniques like data augmentation, regularization, or by using more advanced architectures (ResNet, Inception, etc.).
- **Web Interface Enhancements**: Improve the user experience by adding more visual appeal and allowing for multiple image uploads at once.
- **Model Accuracy**: Fine-tune the model to improve prediction accuracy by adjusting hyperparameters or using a larger dataset.
- **Deployment on Cloud**: Deploy the application on a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS) to make it publicly accessible.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Add a feature for real-time prediction from a webcam feed.
- **Additional Features**: Add more details to the breed prediction, such as information about the breed or characteristics.
